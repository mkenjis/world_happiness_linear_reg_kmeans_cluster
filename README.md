# Purpose:
- use world happiness dataset to train linear regression, decision tree and cluster models.
- use trained regression model to identify which ones have a better performance.
- use cluster model to validate clusters found.

# Requirements:
- Spark installed

# Objective :
- perform steps to extract features and label and submit to a MLlib linear regression and cluster models.
- use different parameters and transformations on data to identify a good model.
